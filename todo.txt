1. Refactor Parser
    -> Class -> StimaParser
    -> Methods -> different parser field matching Methods (consolidation of the matches will be done later once a stable enough parser is done)

2. Log Parser output
    -> Automate parser output logging and track this with git for every parser modification especially regex related changes

2. "Automated Testing"
    -> Hard code number of match elements for all documents;yes, this is counter intuitive and beats the idea of automation but its the only way to test such an application
